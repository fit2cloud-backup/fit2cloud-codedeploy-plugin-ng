* Add "Advanced" section with polling timeout, polling frequency, bundle format (zip, tar, or tgz)
* Prepare plugin for Jenkins' release process (https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Hosting+Plugins)
* Properly handle errors like "Application doesn't exist" (Optional: create the application?)
* Add ability to deploy to multiple deployment groups (nice to have: fetch list of deployment groups for the application)
* Catch deployment in progress error and wait...
